A list of network dentists is available at ameritas.com or by calling Ameritas at 1-800-755-8844.\n\nIf you enroll in Plan A, you can select any licensed dentist of your choice. You may also choose to use a network provider. Using a network provider will limit your out of pocket cost. Also, if you utilize a network provider, the deductible is waived for all covered procedures.\n\nPlan B provides a very basic benefit and payments are based on a fixed schedule of fees.

The length of time depends on the type of qualifying event that gave rise to 6 the COBRA rights. A plan, however, may provide longer periods of coverage beyond the maximum period required by law. When the qualifying event is the covered employee's termination of employment or reduction in hours of employment, qualified beneficiaries are entitled to 18 months of continuation coverage. When the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduction of the employee's hours, and the employee became entitled to Medicare less than 18 months before the qualifying event, COBRA coverage for the employee's spouse and dependents can last until 36 months after the date the employee becomes entitled to Medicare. For example, if a covered employee becomes entitled to Medicare 8 months before the date his/her employment ends (termination of employment is the COBRA qualifying event), COBRA coverage for his/her spouse and children would last 28 months (36 months minus 8 months). For more information on how entitlement to Medicare impacts the length of COBRA coverage, contact the Department of Labor's Employee Benefits Security Administration at askebsa.dol.gov or by calling 1-866-444-3272. For other qualifying events, qualified beneficiaries must be provided 36 months of continuation coverage."

There are some restrictions on when you are eligible to withdraw the contributions that you put into the plan. Please carefully consider all your options before you withdraw money from your retirement plan.\nAll withdrawals and distributions from the plan are subject to federal and state taxes. You may be subject to a 10 percent federal tax penalty if you make a withdrawal before age 59 ½. In addition, the federal government requires that 20 percent of your withdrawal be withheld as a prepayment of your federal income tax due on the taxable portion of the withdrawal. This 20 percent withholding requirement does not apply to direct rollovers to an IRA or a new employer's retirement plan.\n\nMore information at:\nhttps://hr.duke.edu/benefits/retirement/frequently-asked-questions"
